# Smooth Animation (p5.js)

[Live Demo](https://editor.p5js.org/Guanheng_Wang/sketches/I-eMhUuJX)

This project features a single object smoothly moving across the canvas using p5.js.  
It demonstrates fluid motion without any collision logic, focusing on timing and animation feel.

Built with p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding in the browser.
